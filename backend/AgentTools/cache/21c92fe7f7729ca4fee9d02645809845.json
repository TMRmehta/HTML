    "selftext": "In 2016 I was diagnosed with stage 4 of a severely aggressive bone cancer after months of severe pain in my sacrum and left leg. I was diagnosed the month before I turned 16. \n\nEwing\u2019s Sarcoma. Rare, and even rarer to have it where I did. One big angry tumour in my sacrum, wrapping around all the nerves in my leg. \nI named her Shannon. \n\nSo because it was an aggressive cancer, we needed to hit it with an even more aggressive chemo protocol. The protocol I was under would have killed an adult, but because I was/am a kid, it only severely harmed me. I was bedridden for the full year and a bit of treatment. \n\nI did 36 radiation fractions, and 11 rounds of chemo in my induction phase, and then a round every three weeks for a year. It was supposed to be every 2 weeks, but because it was hurting my body and threatening my blood counts so much, we had to add an extra week of recovery time. \n\nIt was the most horrible year of my life. All my friends were out partying and dating and having fun, and I was so sick I couldn\u2019t even go to school. I was barely conscious at all. A few of my friends were amazing during it all and stuck by me, doing everything and anything to help the stress on me and my family. They were bloody amazing, and i\u2019m never going to be able to repay them for making my year that bit easier. \n\nHalfway through treatment, I was admitted to the ICU after a few scary low blood pressure readings. I basically lived in hospital all year so it wasn\u2019t much of a bother. I couldn\u2019t really grasp how sick I was for those 8 days in the ICU until I overheard nurses talking about how if I hadn\u2019t have made it down there that night, I would have died. \n\nSo a few major emergency surgeries later and another few months of treatment, I made it. \n\nI did it. I got my N.E.D (No Evidence of Disease, because there\u2019s never a certain \u201cyou\u2019re cancer free\u201d with Ewings) January this year. I\u2019d won. \nDuring my recovery, I went to physio and learnt how to walk again and got stronger. I even made it to school for a few days. \n\nAnd then the pain started. This time in my ribs on my right side. We treated the pain for a while, and then it was time for my 6 month check up scans. \nI lit up EVERYWHERE. \n\nI had a massive tumour in my spine, wrapping around my spinal cord and causing the pain in my ribs. \nThere were tumours in my ankles and legs and shoulders and lungs. \nIt was official. I\u2019m terminal. \n\nThere\u2019s no way to stop it, and I\u2019m currently on more treatment to at least slow it down and buy me some time. \n\nI\u2019m dying. I\u2019m 17 - 18 in a few months. I\u2019m not ready to die. I can\u2019t. I can\u2019t leave my family and friends behind. \n\nMy mum is my entire world. I love her more than anything and owe her everything I have and ever will have. She\u2019s everything I could ever hope to be and I\u2019m leaving her. She has to lose her daughter. I can\u2019t do that to her. \n\nI\u2019ve got an older sister - my best friend in the world. I can\u2019t leave her either. We promised we\u2019d grow old together. We promised we\u2019d spoil each other\u2019s kids. \n\nAnd then there\u2019s my 12 year old brother - my baby. I\u2019m supposed to look after him, to protect him. And I won\u2019t be able to do that. He\u2019s 12 for Christ\u2019s sake he can\u2019t lose his sister. I can\u2019t do that to him - he should be worrying about not having enough v-bucks on fortnite for the new skin, not about how he\u2019s going to deal with everything when his older sister fucking dies. \n\nAnd my half siblings, a 6 year old sister and a 2 year old brother. I love them more than anything in the entire world. My sister is my best friend and I\u2019m hers. She looks up to me and I can\u2019t leave her. I was supposed to watch them grow up and help her sneak out when she was older. I was supposed to be there to help them with homework and relationship trouble. \nAnd now I can\u2019t. \n\nI\u2019ll never see any of my younger siblings graduate or get their first girlfriends or boyfriends. I\u2019ll never see them get married. I\u2019ll never meet their kids. \n\nAnd the worst part is that they\u2019re all so young that they\u2019re gonna forget me. \nFor the 12 year old, he\u2019ll remember me, but over the years it\u2019s gonna get harder and harder to remember the times we\u2019ve fought or played or bickered. He won\u2019t remember my mannerisms or the times we\u2019d spend hanging out in my room. \nAnd the babies won\u2019t remember anything about me. That\u2019s what\u2019s breaking my heart. \nAll the games and the stories and the lullabies and the secrets - gone. They won\u2019t remember anything. I\u2019ll just be the older sister they never knew that passed away when she was a teenager. \n\nI can\u2019t leave my family behind. I just can\u2019t do it. I\u2019m not ready. \n\nAnd my best friend. The friend that I was planning to move out after school with. The friend that has stuck by me the most. The friend that was ready to carry my children because I couldn\u2019t anymore (thanks to the radiation). The friend that I was going to grow old with and bicker with endlessly. \nI\u2019m not going to have her anymore. And again, I\u2019ll just be the friend she had when she was young that passed away. \n\nI can\u2019t do this. I don\u2019t want to do this. But I don\u2019t have a choice. \n\nMy doctor said he\u2019d be surprised if I made it to the end of the year. That\u2019s 2 months. \n2 months to say my goodbyes and to make as many memories as I can with as many of my loved ones as I can. \nI\u2019m not ready. Please god please I just don\u2019t want to die. \n\nI just needed to vent to someone, anyone. I\u2019m sorry. It\u2019s 1am and everyone\u2019s asleep, and I didn\u2019t want to burden my mum by letting her know I\u2019m feeling like this right now. She worries too much as it is. \n\n\n***UPDATE*** \nSo I\u2019m still here, as you can tell. I\u2019ve been fighting like hell, and it definitely hasn\u2019t been easy - but I\u2019m okay. \nI\u2019m doing well actually (head wise, at least). Pain is under control, nausea is under control and all that Jazz. \nI\u2019ve stopped chemo, because towards the end it had just stopped working altogether. So for now we just zap any problematic tumours with radiation if they start causing too much pain / too many problems. \n\nI\u2019ve recently had a fall, and really smacked my right foot. So it\u2019s been out of action for about a week now, but i\u2019m slowly recovering. \nI\u2019ve also been on oxygen for a couple months now because my lungs just aren\u2019t doing the job completely. Nothing too bad; as in I could technically go without the oxygen\u2019s help - it just wouldn\u2019t be too fun. \n\nOtherwise... I\u2019ve really been okay. (Just don\u2019t ask about my dad. Ugh. Lmao)\nWe all know my time\u2019s coming, but if the time since I\u2019ve made this post has meant anything - it means I can fight a little longer, as long as I\u2019ve got my family and friends behind me. \n\nI appreciate all of you guys that have stuck by me and sent in your continuous support. It was always crazy sweet reading your messages and always really uplifting. So thank you. \n\nHere\u2019s to this not being my last update, either!\nXxxx"

    "selftext": "Hey everyone you might have seen my post on here or comments throughout my time here. A few days ago the hospital oncologist gave me the bad news that my cancer had spread to my lungs. Also that I had a swollen lymph node in the groin that was perceived to be cancerous. \n\nSo yeah I have a 3-5 months if I were to do chemo except I\u2019d be locked away in the hospital with no visitors. The other option is to not take any treatment go into hospice and live for about 2-4 months. We\u2019ve opted for the latter because I wanted to be able to see family before I die. \n\nIt\u2019s been hard the past few days to process this option but we are happy with the decision and are planning for a lot of visits. I\u2019m excited to meet old and new friends I hadn\u2019t met before. It\u2019s a blessing that I didn\u2019t anticipate but it brings me so much joy that\u2019ll I\u2019ll be meeting these people before I go.\n\nAnyways I could go on but I\u2019ll keep this shortish r/cancer I love y\u2019all and thanks for the laughs and support throughout my entire journey. \n\n-Jake"
